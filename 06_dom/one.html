//The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation 
//of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a 
document on the web.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
 documents, allowing programs 
(such as JavaScript) to dynamically access and modify the content,
 structure, and style of a webpage while itâ€™s being viewed.

Key Concepts of the DOM:
Representation of a Webpage:

The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree structure where each node 
is an object that corresponds to a part of
the document, such as an element, attribute, or piece of text.
The document itself (HTML file) is the root of the tree, with elements 
like <html>, <head>, <body>, and their nested child elements forming 
branches and leaves.
Tree-Like Structure:

Every element in the HTML document is represented as a node. There are
 different types of nodes, including:
Element nodes: HTML elements like <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc.
Text nodes: The actual text inside HTML tags.
Attribute nodes: Attributes of HTML elements like class, id, href, etc.
Dynamic Interaction:

With the DOM, you can access and modify any part of the webpage using 
JavaScript. For example, you can:
Change the text of a heading.
Modify styles (e.g., change colors or sizes).
Add or remove elements.
React to user inputs (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
The Browser and DOM:

When a web page is loaded, the browser parses the HTML and builds the DOM 
tree structure. JavaScript can then interact with this tree to make dynamic changes.
This interaction allows modern websites to update content, respond to user actions, 
and manage page behavior without needing a full page reload.
Objects in the DOM:

The document object represents the whole web page and serves as the entry point to 
interact with any element.
You can use methods like:
document.getElementById(id): Find an element by its ID.
document.querySelector(selector): Find elements using CSS selectors.
element.innerHTML or element.innerText: Change the content inside an element.
